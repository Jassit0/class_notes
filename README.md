# Class_notes 
✏️✏️ Class notes from the Tecnolochicas 2023 bootcamp, to make my first web page. ✏️✏️

## Introduction
In the following project there are some codes to run my first web page. I used HTML and CSS as the programming languages.

## What did I build?
I used the basic elements of HTML. I added images through url and files on the computer; I incorporated buttons; I used links to connect my HTML with other documents; I added anchors and classes. I used divisions, and ordered and unordered lists to accommodate the information.

In CSS change the text fonts; I edited the images; and I modified the colors of the page.
